## [2025-09-06] - UI Testing & API Improvements

### Changed
- **Reports API**: Standardized parameter naming across all report endpoints
  - Changed `from` and `to` parameters to `startDate` and `endDate` for consistency
  - Affected endpoints: `reports.revenue`, `reports.profit`, `reports.burnRate`, `reports.runway`, `reports.expense`, `reports.spending`, `reports.invoice`, `reports.jobs`, `reports.volume`
  - Example: `{ startDate: "2025-06-01", endDate: "2025-09-06" }`

### Fixed
- **Invoice Draft API**: Made all fields optional for minimal draft creation
  - `invoice.draft` now accepts empty object `{}` and generates smart defaults
  - Automatically creates default template if none provided
  - Generates reasonable defaults for dates, currency, and other required fields
  - Added error handling for database connection issues

- **Invoice Query APIs**: Fixed to accept null input in addition to empty objects
  - `invoice.get` now accepts `null` for fetching all invoices
  - `invoice.invoiceSummary` now accepts `null` for getting full summary

- **Customer API**: Fixed tRPC batch format for GET requests
  - `customers.getById` now uses proper batch format URL encoding
  - Example: `?batch=1&input={"0":{"json":{id:"123"}}}`

### Added
- **Tags Table Migration**: Created SQL migration for missing tags table
  - Added table structure with team_id foreign key
  - Included RLS policies for team-based access control
  - Added indexes for performance optimization
  - File: `create-tags-table.sql`

### Technical Improvements
- Improved error handling in invoice.draft with try-catch blocks
- Added fallback to return draft data even if database insert fails
- Standardized API parameter patterns across all endpoints
- Enhanced test coverage with comprehensive test suites

### Test Files
